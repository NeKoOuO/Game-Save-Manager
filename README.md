Game Save Manager is an easy-to-use application that allows gamers to back up, restore, and export their game save files. It uses a save location database primarily sourced from [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com), supporting over 12,000 games. The app also allows users to add custom entries for files, folders, and registry data.

## Usage

1. **Backup**: To back up your game saves, select the detected game entries from the Backup tab, and click the `Backup Selected Games` button. You can set the maximum number of backups per game in the settings.
2. **Restore**: To restore game saves, select the detected game backup entries from the Restore tab, then click the `Restore Selected Games` button. The most recent backup for each selected game will be restored. If newer local files are detected compared to the backup, a confirmation prompt will appear.
3. **Export**: To export your backups, click the `Export` button and choose the destination for the `.gsm` file.
